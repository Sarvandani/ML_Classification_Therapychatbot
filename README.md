# NLP_Therapy

The dataset comprises 80 user responses in the "response_text" column, obtained from interactions with a therapy chatbot (downloaded form this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sercanyesiloz/therapy-chatbot-nlp/input)). The chatbot prompted the user with the statement: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else.' The users provided their responses, and these responses are classified into two categories: 'not flagged' and 'flagged'.

In this classification task, our goal is to predict whether a user's response should be 'flagged' or 'not flagged' based on their input. If a response is classified as 'not flagged', the user can continue interacting with the chatbot. However, if it is classified as 'flagged', the user is referred to seek additional help or assistance.
To accomplish this prediction, we will use the provided dataset to train a machine learning model.
